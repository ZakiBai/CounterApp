disabled_rules: # rule identifiers turned on by default to exclude from running
  - colon
  - comma
  - control_statement
opt_in_rules: # some rules are turned off by default, so you need to opt-in
  - empty_count # find all the available rules by running: `swiftlint rules`

analyzer_rules: # rules run by `swiftlint analyze`
  - explicit_self
